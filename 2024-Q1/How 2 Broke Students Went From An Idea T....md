### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?
你好！您是谁？您创办了什么企业？

Hey fellow entrepreneurs, my name is Joosep Seitam and I will share a story with you on how I went from having a crazy idea to making $30,000 per month in just 8 months in the jewelry industry. Me and Martin Kardi started a business that sells gold-plated [moissanite hip hop jewelry](https://icecartel.com/collections/moissanite-hip-hop-jewelry).  
各位创业者大家好，我的名字是 Joosep Seitam，我将与大家分享一个故事，讲述我如何在珠宝行业从一个疯狂的想法到在短短 8 个月内每月赚取 30,000 美元。我和 Martin Kardi 创办了一家销售镀金莫桑石嘻哈珠宝的公司。

The products that we are selling are directed to afro american people living in the USA. The jewelry that we sell is very specific. It's called hip-hop jewelry.   
我们销售的产品针对居住在美国的非裔美国人。我们销售的珠宝非常具体。这就是所谓的嘻哈珠宝。

Within just 8 months we scaled this business up to making $30,000 in revenue solely from doing SEO. Within these 8 months, our organic monthly traffic is surpassing 10,000 visitors per month.  
在短短 8 个月内，我们仅通过 SEO 就将这项业务扩大到 30,000 美元的收入。在这 8 个月内，我们的每月自然流量超过 10,000 名访客。

Here's me \& Martin 2 years ago, broke and not knowing what the future holds...  
这是两年前的我和马丁，他们身无分文，不知道未来会怎样......

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?
您的背景故事是什么？您是如何想到这个想法的？

As of September 2023, I'm a 22-year-old university dropout from Tallinn, Estonia. I started my first business when I was just 16 years old. I used to run a gardening business in the richest neighborhood of Estonia. I started it in 2016 and within 3 years we scaled the business up to become the biggest name in the gardening business. But at the back of my head, I always wanted to do something in the e-commerce space.  
截至 2023 年 9 月，我是一名来自爱沙尼亚塔林的 22 岁大学辍学生。我16岁时就开始了我的第一笔生意。我曾经在爱沙尼亚最富有的社区经营园艺生意。我于 2016 年开始经营，三年内我们将业务规模扩大到成为园艺行业的巨头。但在我的内心深处，我一直想在电子商务领域做点什么。

So in 2019, I got into dropshipping and I had success with the first-ever store that I launched. I sold Halloween masks that you probably have seen in the horror movie "The Purge". I made $37,000 in just 16 days by running Facebook AD-s (It was the time when Facebook could track every movement of their users and it was very easy to make money off of Facebook AD-s).  
因此，在 2019 年，我进入了直销业务，并成功开设了第一家商店。我卖了你可能在恐怖电影《净化》中见过的万圣节面具。通过运行 Facebook AD-s，我在短短 16 天内就赚了 37,000 美元（当时 Facebook 可以跟踪用户的每一个动作，从 Facebook AD-s 赚钱非常容易）。

However as it was a seasonal business, I quickly had to build up new online stores selling more evergreen products. Unfortunately, I didn't have any luck with the following stores so I started to lose belief in dropshipping.  
然而，由于这是一个季节性业务，我很快就不得不建立新的网上商店，销售更多常青产品。不幸的是，我在以下商店没有任何运气，所以我开始对代发货失去信心。

Fortunately, there was one business that I had success with and it was selling designer clothes on platforms like Grailed.com and Etsy.com. I ran that business until I got banned from the platform because I was dropshipping -_-  
幸运的是，我在一项业务上取得了成功，那就是在 Grailed.com 和 Etsy.com 等平台上销售名牌服装。我经营这项业务，直到因为我从事代发货而被该平台禁止 -_-

In 2021 I went to the military and all my business ventures stopped for 8 months. In the military, I met someone who changed my life forever and with whom we had multiple successful business ventures to come.  
2021年，我参军了，所有的生意都停止了8个月。在军队里，我遇到了一个永远改变了我生活的人，我们和他一起进行了多次成功的商业冒险。

Together we started 2 businesses: socialplug.io and Adsellr.com. We are still running them today and these businesses in combination are making around $50-$70k revenue every month.  
我们一起创办了两家公司：socialplug.io 和 Adsellr.com。我们今天仍在运营这些业务，这些业务每月的收入合计约为 50-70,000 美元。

During our ventures, I learned one very specific skill - SEO. I had a very big learning curve, spending over $100,000 per year on doing SEO the wrong way until I learned from my mistakes and this is what helped me to understand what a magic SEO is and how you could turn a business into a long term business by just ranking relevant keywords on Google.  
在我们的创业过程中，我学到了一项非常具体的技能------搜索引擎优化。我有一个非常大的学习曲线，每年花费超过 100,000 美元以错误的方式进行 SEO，直到我从错误中吸取教训，这帮助我理解什么是神奇的 SEO 以及如何将业务转变为长期业务只需在 Google 上对相关关键字进行排名即可。

**How I came up with the idea behind Icecartel?
我是如何想到 Icecartel 背后的想法的？**

This business idea came to me simply because my partner Martin was already running a jewelry business on a small scale and it was working, but he didn't have enough funds to grow his business on a scale.   
我之所以产生这个商业想法，只是因为我的合伙人马丁已经在小规模地经营珠宝业务，并且它正在发挥作用，但他没有足够的资金来大规模发展他的业务。

From that point, I knew that if he made money with so little effort, we could partner up and build up a brand [Icecartel](https://icecartel.com/) where we could invest around $60,000. And so we did...  
从那时起，我就知道，如果他不费吹灰之力就能赚钱，我们就可以合作建立一个品牌 Icecartel，我们可以投资大约 60,000 美元。所以我们做了......

I didn't have any knowledge about the jewelry business myself when I started, but I quickly started learning about the jewelry industry on the Internet. There are videos on YouTube about how to create a moissanite jewelry business.  
刚开始的时候我自己对珠宝行业并没有任何了解，但是我很快就开始在互联网上了解珠宝行业。 YouTube 上有一些关于如何创建莫桑钻珠宝业务的视频。

Sourcing products was easy, my partner had connections with the suppliers. We simply used the same supplier who had done quality work for Martin's jewelry business in the past.  
采购产品很容易，我的合作伙伴与供应商有联系。我们只是使用了过去为马丁珠宝业务提供过优质服务的同一家供应商。

You can start a jewelry business with much less starting funds. We were just outsourcing almost everything. That's why our costs were so high.  
您可以用更少的启动资金开始珠宝业务。我们几乎把所有事情都外包了。这就是为什么我们的成本如此之高。

### Take us through the process of building the first version of your product.
带领我们完成构建产品第一个版本的过程。

The process was simple. We ordered velvet sheets to the factory with the Icecartel logo and paid the manufacturer to take pictures and videos of the jewelry that they had in stock. Here's a reference image of how the product pictures turned out:   
过程很简单。我们向工厂订购了带有 Icecartel 标志的天鹅绒床单，并付钱给制造商，让他们为他们库存的珠宝拍摄照片和视频。以下是产品图片的参考图片：

![](https://image.cubox.pro/cardImg/2024012417035852621/31494.jpg?imageMogr2/quality/90/ignore-error/1)

What we had a challenge with was custom packaging. We tried to find something extra premium and so we ordered handmade leather cases that gave the products an extra luxury feel. However, these boxes came at a very high cost. We ended up paying around $100 for a jewelry box so we had to find a new supplier and we had to buy boxes in larger quantities.   
我们面临的挑战是定制包装。我们试图找到一些额外的优质产品，因此我们订购了手工制作的皮套，这给产品带来了额外的奢华感。然而，这些盒子的成本非常高。我们最终花了大约 100 美元购买了一个珠宝盒，因此我们必须寻找新的供应商，并且必须购买更多数量的盒子。

We ended up paying $50 per leather jewelry box for the next batch. Here's an image of our jewelry box:   
我们最终为下一批的每个皮革首饰盒支付了 50 美元。这是我们的珠宝盒的图片：

![](https://image.cubox.pro/cardImg/2024012417035830593/53792.jpg?imageMogr2/quality/90/ignore-error/1)

We got the leather jewelry box idea from a very high-end jewelry company icebox.com and we were very specific about how the jewelry box should look like.  
我们从一家非常高端的珠宝公司 Icebox.com 那里得到了皮革珠宝盒的想法，我们对珠宝盒的外观非常具体。

### Describe the process of launching the business.
描述启动业务的过程。

**The first 2 months: 前 2 个月：**

With my prior SEO knowledge, I knew that the specific industry that we were targeting was relatively new and the competitors hadn't done any SEO or had done it very poorly.  
凭借我之前的 SEO 知识，我知道我们针对的特定行业相对较新，竞争对手没有做过任何 SEO 或做得很差。

The first huge investment we made was to buy an expired domain which cost us $6,500 and an Instagram name which cost us around $3,000.  
我们做的第一笔巨额投资是花费 6,500 美元购买一个过期域名和一个 Instagram 名称，花费大约 3,000 美元。

Then I created a website that I optimized for the first 2 months to be as SEO-friendly as possible.  
然后我创建了一个网站，并在前两个月进行了优化，以尽可能地对 SEO 友好。

We didn't have any money to buy ourselves samples for product images, fortunately, our supplier did the pictures for us for free.  
我们没有钱给自己买产品图片的样品，幸运的是，我们的供应商免费为我们制作了图片。

We also connected a payment gateway Stripe but didn't have any luck with it because they said that we are a high-risk business because we are selling products that can go up to $10,000 per item.  
我们还连接了支付网关 Stripe，但没有成功，因为他们说我们是一家高风险企业，因为我们销售的产品每件商品的价格最高可达 10,000 美元。

So we couldn't accept payments and I had to start digging out all payment gateways there were.  
所以我们无法接受付款，我不得不开始挖掘所有的支付网关。

**The next 2-6 Months: 未来 2-6 个月：**

During these months I wrote around 100 blog posts gathered over 160 backlinks and grew the organic traffic from 100 visitors per month to 8,000 organic visitors per month.  
在这几个月里，我写了大约 100 篇博客文章，收集了 160 多个反向链接，并将自然流量从每月 100 名访问者增加到每月 8,000 名自然访问者。

We also found a payment gateway in the 6th month. It took me 4 months to find a payment gateway.  
我们还在第 6 个月找到了支付网关。我花了4个月才找到支付网关。

At the end of the sixth month, we had spent around $40,000 to start this business.  
第六个月末，我们花费了大约 40,000 美元来开展这项业务。

If you need help with payment gateways or SEO, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.  
如果您需要支付网关或 SEO 方面的帮助，请随时在 LinkedIn 上与我联系。

**7-8th Month 7-8月**

In the 7th month, we got our payment gateway integrated and within the first 15 days, our business generated over $20,000 in revenue with around 50% profit margin.  
第 7 个月，我们集成了支付网关，在前 15 天内，我们的业务收入超过 20,000 美元，利润率约为 50%。

On the 8th. month our organic traffic has grown to almost 10,000 visitors per month.  
8号。一个月后，我们的有机流量已增长至每月近 10,000 名访客。

Currently, we are generating $30,000 per month and we are working with Youtube influencers who are making review videos for us.  
目前，我们每月赚取 30,000 美元，并且正在与 Youtube 影响者合作，他们为我们制作评论视频。

In the jewelry business, the hardest thing is to build trust. As there are other established jewelry businesses with thousands of reviews, it takes a lot of time, money, and effort to build up social proof.  
在珠宝行业，最难的事情就是建立信任。由于其他成熟的珠宝企业拥有数千条评论，因此需要花费大量时间、金钱和精力来建立社会认同。

We are sending our influencers jewelry that costs us thousands per piece but that's how we will take our business to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars per month.  
我们向有影响力的人发送珠宝，每件价值数千美元，但这就是我们如何让我们的业务每月赚取数十万美元。

Probably the biggest lesson I learned from this business is that in a big ocean, even small fish get's his part. The fact that there are competitors in the jewelry industry who are making everything better than you are, you can still get customers if you target them from a point where others aren't.  
也许我从这件事中学到的最大教训是，在大海中，即使是小鱼也能得到自己的一份。事实上，珠宝行业的竞争对手在一切方面都比您做得更好，如果您从其他人无法做到的地方瞄准客户，您仍然可以获得客户。

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?
自推出以来，哪些因素有效吸引并留住了客户？

You should always offer the clients what other companies are not. In our case, we offer our customers a custom leather jewelry box where they can store their jewelry and take them on trips.   
您应该始终为客户提供其他公司所没有的服务。就我们而言，我们为客户提供定制皮革首饰盒，他们可以在其中存放珠宝并携带它们去旅行。

Also, you should try to be where your customers are hanging around. Again in our case, we saw people searching for very niche-specific keywords on Google and we started doing SEO to rank with these keywords. Just solely on the SEO, we are at the stage where we are today.   
另外，你应该尽量呆在顾客经常光顾的地方。在我们的案例中，我们看到人们在 Google 上搜索非常特定的关键词，我们开始进行 SEO 来对这些关键词进行排名。仅在搜索引擎优化方面，我们就处于今天的阶段。

Here's how our website traffic has grown from 0 organic visitors per month to almost 10,000 visitors per month (screenshot from ahrefs.com):  
以下是我们的网站流量如何从每月 0 名自然访问者增长到每月近 10,000 名访问者（来自 ahrefs.com 的屏幕截图）：

![](https://image.cubox.pro/cardImg/2024012417040156966/26386.jpg?imageMogr2/quality/90/ignore-error/1)

Do you want to know how I'm doing it? Here's how:
你想知道我是怎么做的吗？就是这样：
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing I always do is topical / keyword research. With every business I'm starting, I will always find all relevant keywords to the business and manually list them in a Google Sheets file.   
我总是做的第一件事是主题/关键词研究。对于我开始的每一项业务，我总是会找到与该业务相关的所有关键字，并手动将它们列在 Google 表格文件中。

Here's an example of the Google Sheets file (keyword research):  
以下是 Google 表格文件的示例（关键字研究）：

![](https://image.cubox.pro/cardImg/2024012417040125737/29717.jpg?imageMogr2/quality/90/ignore-error/1)

To get help with finding relevant keywords, I'm using Ahrefs.com.   
为了获得查找相关关键字的帮助，我使用 Ahrefs.com。

If you don't know how to find relevant keywords, It's always best to look at what keywords your competitors are ranking with.   
如果您不知道如何查找相关关键字，最好查看竞争对手的排名关键字。

Once you have all the keywords, you should start with the on-page SEO. You simply have to have all the relevant keywords on the page that you want to rank with.   
一旦你有了所有的关键词，你应该从页面搜索引擎优化开始。您只需在要排名的页面上包含所有相关关键字即可。

In our case, I wanted to rank collection page keywords so I categorized all the keywords I found into collections and then I started writing copy for them.   
在我们的例子中，我想对集合页面关键字进行排名，因此我将找到的所有关键字分类到集合中，然后开始为它们编写副本。

While writing copy you have to bear in mind how much content you should write to rank. You can determine this by looking at the competitor sites.   
在撰写文案时，您必须记住应该编写多少内容才能排名。您可以通过查看竞争对手的网站来确定这一点。

Once you have done the copy and once It's implemented on the website, It's time to start doing internal linking.   
完成复制并在网站上实施后，就可以开始进行内部链接了。

Internal linking is a very important part of on-page SEO because it allows your site to get an extra SEO boost.   
内部链接是页面搜索引擎优化的一个非常重要的部分，因为它可以让您的网站获得额外的搜索引擎优化提升。

The home page should always have most, if not all links visible to other collection or product pages.   
主页应该始终具有大多数（如果不是全部）对其他集合或产品页面可见的链接。

Once the internal linking was done for all the pages, I started building links.   
一旦所有页面的内部链接完成，我就开始构建链接。

Link building can be seen as a hard thing to do at first, but it's very easy when you get on doing it.   
链接建设一开始可能被认为是一件很难做的事情，但是当你开始做的时候，它就变得非常容易了。

I started the link-building process by going over all competitors' backlinks one by one and made a list of 1000+ links to outreach to.  
我通过一一检查所有竞争对手的反向链接开始链接构建过程，并列出了 1000 多个要外展的链接。

Before I started the link outreach, I bought a new domain and made a Google Workspace Account. Then I used Instantly.ai to warm up the new email I had just made.   
在开始链接推广之前，我购买了一个新域名并创建了一个 Google Workspace 帐号。然后我使用 Instantly.ai 来预热我刚刚发送的新电子邮件。

I warmed up the email for 14 days and then I started the outreach. Thanks to instantly.ai and their email warmup, the email open rate was around 50%. It's a great hack to use instantly.ai warmup service for anyone who's into email marketing.   
我对电子邮件进行了 14 天的预热，然后开始外展。感谢 instant.ai 和他们的电子邮件预热，电子邮件打开率约为 50%。对于任何从事电子邮件营销的人来说，使用 instant.ai 预热服务是一个很棒的技巧。

Then out of hundreds of replies I got back, I started to research whether the site was worth getting a link from. You can do it by looking at where the majority of their traffic is coming from and whether they haven't had any huge traffic fluctuations. Traffic fluctuations indicate that these might be PBN (private blog network) websites that are selling backlinks to their websites. You should always avoid PBNs and go for sites that have healthy growth in terms of traffic and sites that don't publish restricted content like casino or adult content.   
然后，在收到的数百条回复中，我开始研究该网站是否值得获取链接。您可以通过查看他们的大部分流量来自哪里以及他们是否没有出现任何巨大的流量波动来做到这一点。流量波动表明这些可能是 PBN（私人博客网络）网站，正在出售其网站的反向链接。您应该始终避免 PBN，并选择流量健康增长的网站以及不发布赌场或成人内容等受限制内容的网站。

The next thing is to write guest posts for their sites. The guest post should always be relevant to the site's content and I don't recommend using AI for writing the content as you might get penalized by Google's new AI updates.   
接下来的事情是为他们的网站撰写客座帖子。来宾帖子应该始终与网站的内容相关，我不建议使用人工智能来编写内容，因为你可能会受到谷歌新人工智能更新的惩罚。

Inside the guest posts your goal is to link some anchor text to your site. You should have a proper anchor text strategy in place where you are mostly focused on the home page at first and then on collection, product, or blog pages.   
在访客帖子中，您的目标是将一些锚文本链接到您的网站。您应该制定适当的锚文本策略，首先主要关注主页，然后关注产品系列、产品或博客页面。

Be careful with the anchor texts because they should look natural and you shouldn't get links from all the sites with the same anchor text. It just looks very unnatural and it might get you penalized.   
请小心锚文本，因为它们应该看起来很自然，并且您不应该从具有相同锚文本的所有网站获得链接。它看起来很不自然，可能会让你受到惩罚。

I'm able to guide anyone through the process who's interested.  
我能够指导任何感兴趣的人完成整个过程。

Building Topical Authority:  
建立话题权威：

No doubt that today the most important ranking factor is Topical Authority. To put it simply, topical authority means that you have covered every topic within your niche that people are searching for on Google. In Google's eyes, if you have covered every topic there is within your niche, they have nothing else to do but to award your site with higher rankings on Google.   
毫无疑问，当今最重要的排名因素是主题权威。简而言之，主题权威意味着您已经涵盖了人们在 Google 上搜索的您所在领域内的每个主题。在谷歌看来，如果你已经涵盖了你的利基市场中的每一个主题，他们除了奖励你的网站在谷歌上获得更高的排名之外别无他法。

Within 8 months I wrote around 100 blogs and covered all topics there are about moissanite diamonds and currently I'm covering all topics there are about chains \& necklaces.   
在 8 个月内，我写了大约 100 篇博客，涵盖了有关莫桑钻的所有主题，目前我正在涵盖有关链条和项链的所有主题。

Doing topical authority is a great way to start doing SEO without spending any money on it. Without link building on blogs and solely on writing around 100 blogs, my website traffic doubled.  
获得主题权威是开始进行 SEO 的好方法，而无需花费任何金钱。无需在博客上建立链接，仅撰写大约 100 个博客，我的网站流量就增加了一倍。

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?
通过创业，您是否学到了任何特别有用或有利的东西？

Probably the biggest stepping stone was finding the payment gateway. Now I know how to approach payment processors and how to fall into the low-risk category. Until now all my businesses have fallen into the category of high risk.   
也许最大的垫脚石是找到支付网关。现在我知道如何接触支付处理商以及如何落入低风险类别。到目前为止，我的所有业务都属于高风险类别。

The fact why my company fell into high risk is that it was a new business and I didn't have any processing history. I was dropshipping and payment processors don't like that because my business depends on the success of the supplier. If anything happens to them, I'm out of business.   
我的公司之所以陷入高风险，是因为它是一项新业务，而我没有任何处理历史。我是直接发货，但付款处理商不喜欢这样，因为我的业务取决于供应商的成功。如果他们出了什么事，我就破产了。

The business fell into the high-risk category also because the products that I'm selling are selling at thousands of dollars. In case of any chargebacks, it will be risky for the banks.   
该业务属于高风险类别还因为我销售的产品售价数千美元。如果发生退款，银行将面临风险。

I also learned that the timing of starting this business was right. People are starting to know about what moissanite jewelry is and how much cheaper they are from real diamond jewelry. This can also be seen from the increase in search volume for the relevant keywords:  
我还了解到，开展这项业务的时机是正确的。人们开始了解什么是莫桑石珠宝，以及它们比真正的钻石珠宝便宜多少。从相关关键词搜索量的增加也可以看出这一点：

Honestly, to make something like this work you should train a habit of hard work and belief in yourself. Everything is possible if you keep grinding. That's where 99% of the people fail. I didn't see any money for the first 8 months. But it was the work ethic and belief that if someone made it then I can do it too, and I will give my best to make it better than others.  
老实说，要让这样的事情成功，你应该培养努力工作的习惯和对自己的信心。只要坚持不懈，一切皆有可能。这就是99%的人失败的地方。前8个月我没有看到任何钱。但这是一种职业道德和信念，如果有人做到了，那么我也能做到，而且我会尽我所能，让它比其他人更好。

最有影响力的书籍、播客或其他资源是什么？

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?
对其他想要创业或刚刚起步的企业家有何建议？

The only way to get started is to trade your time for money. Try to develop a skill and offer a service on platforms like Fiverr or Upwork.   
唯一开始的方法就是用你的时间换取金钱。尝试发展一项技能并在 Fiverr 或 Upwork 等平台上提供服务。

The main mistake that I'm seeing is why people don't start anything because they want someone to teach them. But the reality is that no one can teach you how to make money. You have to go through the process yourself. I know It's hard and It's hard for a reason. Nothing comes to you on a silver platter.  
我看到的主要错误是为什么人们不开始任何事情，因为他们希望有人教他们。但现实是没有人能教你如何赚钱。你必须自己经历这个过程。我知道这很难，而且这很难是有原因的。没有什么是银盘上的。
